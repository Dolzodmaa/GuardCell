        <h1>How do plants get carbon source?</h1>
        <p>Unlike many animals like us eating with mouth to get necessary carbon to fulfill carbon and energy requirement, plants have many microscopic pores on leaves that are encompassed by a pair of guard cells called stomata, they have thousands of mouths to allow the CO2 to get in the plant and then the photosynthesis works to assimilate the carbon and also generate energy. Another function of stomata seems similar to sweat gland we have, which is controlling the water release from the plants, to either cool down the plants when the weather is warm or keep the water inside when they encounter drought stres</p>
        <p>There are many questions being raised regarding stomata function and many perspective of models were proposed and improved to better understand these questions. For example, the commonly asked question is how is stomata regulated? A current simplified mechanical model for the question is that as the stimuli gets sensed, the water is regulated to move in to or out from the guard cells. When the water is signaled to move in to the guard cells, the cell would inflate, the stoma in between the cells gets larger, so that there are more water and CO2 allowed to exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Vice versa if the water is signaled to move out from guard cells.</p>
        <p>This mechanical model intrigued scientists from different background. Our group is consist of plant biologists, engineering scientists and computer scientists. We are trying to understand the biological and physical basis of guard cell movement, and potentially apply what we learned to develop “super guard cells” to help improve crop yield. </p>
