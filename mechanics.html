        <h1><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction to the Biomechanics of Stomata</span></h1>
        <p style="font-size:120%;">Mechanics is a field of study that tries to understand energy and forces, and how these affect physical objects. The mechanical properties of a given material determine how an object made up of that material will behave when it is subjected to a force. An object made of a certain material will deform differently depending on the location and direction of the force applied to it; for example, a steel rod will resist a parallel force is applied to its end, but will bend when a perpendicular force is applied to its middle. The material properties of an object will also determine whether it will recover its original shape and size when the imposed force is removed; for example, a rubber band can be stretched and will return to its original shape when the stretching force is removed, but a similar band made of plastic will stretch and remain in its stretched-out shape once the stretching force is removed. </p>

          <div class="column1">

            <figcaption class="cap"> <strong>Figure 2. </strong>A stretched rubber band will return to its original shape when the stretching force is removed. A similar band made of plastic will remain in its stretched-out shape when the stretching force is removed.</figcaption>

        <p style="font-size:120%;">Additionally, the shape, size, and where and how an object is supported can also determine the behavior of that object when a force is applied. This aspect of an object is referred as its structure. Again taking a steel rod as an example, if it is placed on a solid surface and a perpendicular force is applied to its middle, the rod will not bend, but if the same rod is placed between two end supports and the same force is applied, it will bend. Knowing an object’s material and structure makes it possible to understand and predict how that object will deform in response to a force.</p>

           <img src="Mechanics_Figure_3.gif" style="width:450px; height: 300px" alt="intro1" align="middle">
           <figcaption class="cap3"> <strong> Figure 3.</strong> When steel rod is placed on a rigid surface, even a perpendicular force applied to its middle will not bend. When this steel road is placed on a two end supports, the same peperdincular force applied to its middle will bend the same steel rod.</figcaption>
           </figure>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:120%;">The cell walls of stomatal guard cells are thought to be elastic, because a guard cell pair returns to its original shape and size after a cycle of opening, then closing. The guard cell wall is also thought to be “anisotropic” because it appears to deform more in one direction than other directions, resulting in the cell getting longer but not wider, much as a Slinky toy can get longer but not much wider. Structurally, we can think of a guard cell as a pressure vessel, sort of like a propane tank, because it withstands a high internal pressure. Therefore, the guard cell wall acts as a flexible exoskeleton, or <q>flexoskeleton </q>, that can grow and shrink while not breaking, even though it experiences a large amount of force. </p>
        <div id="m_img4">
          <figure>
           <img src="Mechanics_Figure_4.gif" style="width:450px;height:300px;" alt="intro1" align="middle">
           <figcaption class="cap3"> <strong>Figure 4. </strong> The guard cell wall is thought to be anisotropic because it deforms in one direction more than two other directions like a Slinky. Because guard cell withstands a high internal pressure, guard cell wall  acts as a flexible exoskeleton, or <q
            >flexoskeleton</q> that can grow and shrink with a large amount of internal pressure.</figcaption>
           </figure>
        </div>

        <p style="font-size:120%;">Additionally, the combination of the geometry of stomatal guard cell pairs, plus the configurations of how guard cells make contacts with and are supported by neighboring cells, contribute to the repeated and controlled dynamics of the stomatal complex and allow for efficient photosynthesis and water transport in plants.</p>
        <div id="m_img5">
          <figure>
           <img src="Mechanics_Figure_5.gif" style="width:450px;height:300px;" alt="intro1" align="middle">
           <figcaption class="cap3"> <strong> Figure 5.</strong> A stomatal guard cell pair is supported by neighboring cells. The combination of these contacts and the geometry of stomatal guard cell pairs contribute to the repeated and controlled dynamics of stomatal complex.</figcaption>
           </figure>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:120%;">In summary, stomata guard cells facilitate the mechanical processes of stomatal opening and closure to control gas exchange in plants. It has long been thought that the regulation of internal pressure triggers stomatal opening and closure, but how this internal pressure interacts with the flexible but strong cell wall is still pretty mysterious. The mechanics of stomatal complexes are the culmination of biochemical synthesis, cell shape, and biophysical processes. All of these contribute to defining the biomechanics of stomata.</p>
